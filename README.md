## Bakery Order Processing Web App

### Start App

1. `git clone https://github.com/tom-curphey/bakery.git`
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn start`

### Deployed App

[https://tom-curphey.github.io/bakery](https://tom-curphey.github.io/bakery 'Link to deployed app')

### Current Thoughts

- The user uploads current products in csv file format
- The User then can upload purchase orders to get desired pack information
- Using the mathimatical formula I choose to minimise costs for the customer as long as we weren't increasing the items for packaging. This create a different price & combinations of packs for the product MB11 Blueberry Muffin

### What is needed to put app into production

- If this app was apart of somthing bigger I would separate the compoents into individual files
- I set the loading & file uploaded flags, I would use this to show the user feedback on what is happening in the app
